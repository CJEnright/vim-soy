# vim-soy

Syntax highlighting file for editing Google's Closure templating language.

To install, just copy the syntax/ and ftdetect/ directories to a directory in your runtimepath (~/.vim on Linux, $HOME/vimfiles in Windows)

Note that while I would like to add auto-indenting, it is currently beyond my skills. Help would be greatly appreciated.
